#LCD_MATH_GAME 
in this project I used a function that takes a random value from the clock source of the microcontroller and you can as a user choose the difficulty you want 
to play on whether easy, medium, hard, professional, and in every difficulty, the digits of the competition increase a number the user who is playing that game has a score 
in every mode and every game whether it is adding or subtracting or multiplication or random question.
